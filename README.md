===============================

When the Game is launched from index.html, wait for the prompt. The prompt will ask of you how difficult do you want the game with numbers for each category. You must take the character and get to the river which is the blue area. You are able to move using up, down, left, right keys on your keyboard. You must avoid getting hit by the enemy. There are items lying around but they do not do anything as of yet. Maybe in a later version, something might happen when you get to the item.
